        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Many health apps on the market today focus on collecting and displaying data, but they often fall short when it comes to providing meaningful analysis or practical guidance. Users are left with numbers and charts but no real understanding of what their health data means or how to use it to improve their well-being. At the same time, access to therapy has become more difficult, whether due to high costs, long wait times, or the discomfort some individuals feel when seeking professional help. As a result, many people are left without the support and insights they need to take control of their health and mental well-being.</p>
